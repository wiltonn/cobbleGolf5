# Task ID: 4
# Title: Tee Time Search Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the functionality to search for available tee times on Wednesdays.
# Details:
Create the tee time search functionality:
- Implement date calculation to find the next Wednesday at least one week in the future
- Create functions to navigate to the appropriate date range
- Implement parsing of available time slots
- Add filtering based on preferences (time of day, etc.)
- Create data structures to store and sort available times
- Implement error handling for when no times are available

# Test Strategy:
Test the search functionality by running it against the actual website and verifying that it correctly identifies available tee times. Compare the results with manual searches to ensure accuracy.
